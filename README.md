# PreAmpArduino

This is the Arduino code needed to support a design which will do the following:
- select between 3 input ports
- 64 steps volume control
- mute
- standby
- support output to steer relay powering (pre)AMP

Code is based on:
- implementation of AMP's build by Jos van Eindhoven
- PassivePreamp available on DIY audio

current state:
still in development, to be implemented
1 per channel volume
2 store settings in eeprom
3 implement menu to change specific settings
4 verify oled screen recovery after standby
