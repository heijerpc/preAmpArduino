# PreAmpArduino

This is the Arduino code needed to support a design which will do the following:
- select between 4 input ports
- 64 steps volume control
- mute
- standby mode
- support output led to steer relay powering (pre)AMP
- support output led to steer relay to switch passive and active
- support output led steer relay to switch between amp and headphones
- output led to light a LED if device is in standby
- rotary for volume control
- oled screen to show releveant info
- support for balance, balance is turned off if headphones is active
- balance is configurable via a menu
- choice between a configurable generic volume level for startup or a volume level per input channel. All values are configurabel.

Code is based on:
- implementation of AMP's build by Jos van Eindhoven
- PassivePreamp available on DIY audio

current state:
still in development, to be implemented
- ir codes
- new oled screen
- design and support for new oled screen
- test of software
- test of output ports, see if support using transistor works
- setup menu is now only available via rotary, question if we should also support ir
